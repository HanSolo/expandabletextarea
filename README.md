## Expandable TextArea
A JavaFX expandable TextArea where you also can limit the number of characters.


## Overview
![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HanSolo/expandabletextarea/master/ExpandableTextArea.png)


## Features
You can define the number of characters that are allowed in the textarea and the 
character threshold that defines the point where an additional label will appear
and will show you the number of characters left before you reach the limit.
In addition you can define the number of lines that should be shown in the collapsed
state.
If the ExandableTextArea is in the expanded state (expandable == true) it will automatically grow/shrink 
dependend on the size and the amount of text it contains.
It doesn't show scroll bars because they should not be needed.

Here is a little [video](https://youtu.be/DTwR8Z-a5b8) that gives you an idea on how it works.
